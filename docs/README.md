# Multi-Environment Microservices Platform

## Overview
This platform provides a complete microservices infrastructure on Azure with:
- Multi-environment support (dev, staging, production)
- GitOps-based deployment with Flux
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Configuration management with Ansible
- Full observability stack

## Prerequisites
- Azure subscription
- Azure CLI installed
- Terraform >= 1.0
- kubectl
- Flux CLI
- Ansible

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Configure Azure credentials
3. Initialize Terraform backend
4. Deploy infrastructure:
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   ./deploy.sh production
   ```

## Architecture
- **AKS Clusters**: Managed Kubernetes for each environment
- **Azure Container Registry**: Private container registry
- **Application Gateway**: Ingress controller with WAF
- **Virtual Networks**: Network segmentation and security
- **GitOps**: Automated deployment with Flux

## Environment Configuration
Each environment has isolated:
- Virtual networks and subnets
- AKS clusters with auto-scaling
- Container registries
- Application gateways
- Monitoring stacks

## Security Features
- Network segmentation with VNets and NSGs
- WAF-enabled Application Gateway
- RBAC with Azure AD integration
- Network policies in Kubernetes
- Container image scanning in ACR

## Monitoring
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Azure Monitor integration
- Fluent Bit for log aggregation
- Application Insights for APM

## Deployment Process
1. Infrastructure provisioned via Terraform
2. GitOps configured with Flux
3. Applications deployed via Git commits
4. Ansible configures supporting VMs
5. Monitoring stack deployed automatically

## Maintenance
- Regular AKS upgrades
- Automated certificate rotation
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Cost optimization with auto-scaling
